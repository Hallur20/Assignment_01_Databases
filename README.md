# Assignment_01_Databases

<p>this project uses a binary file (binaryFile.txt) as it's form for a database.</p>

<p>In this program you will be able to choose between options in the database such as:<br/> <b>see all data, insert new data, see data depending on the id-key</b></p>


In order to make it work, clone the project first and then you have two options:
<ul>
  <li>1. Open the project folder in netbeans IDE and then push 'F6' to run it in the output terminal</li>
  <li>2. Open the project folder and navigate to the runProject folder. Then click on start.bat in order to run the project in the command prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you have a terminal set up and working you should be greeted by these instructions:</p>
<p>welcome! instructions:<br><emsp>type 'get all' to find all data<br><emsp>type 'get (key value)' to find a key-row!<br><emsp>type 'set (key value) (name value) (age value)' to create something!<br><emsp>type 'instructions' to see instructions again<br><emsp>type 'hashmap' to see the keys and their offsets from the binary file<emsp>type 'exit' to close program</p>
  
<p>these are commands you can type, in order to make something happen (you have to make a space between the words). Here are some examples on what you can write:</p>

<p>get all -> shows all data in binary file...</p>
<p>get 25 -> shows (if there is any) the data that has to do with id-key 25.</p>
<p>set 24 Peter 31 -> inserts data with the id-key of 24. Name is Peter and his age is 31.</p>
<p>instructions -> shows the instructions again that were shown when the program started.</p>
<p>hashmap -> shows the keys / offsets saved in the hashmap</p>
<p>exit -> exits the program.</p>
